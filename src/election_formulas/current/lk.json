The completed registration application must be returned to the clerk by the close of the polls on election day in order for the ballot to be counted and may not be sealed with the voted absentee ballot. If the application is received during the closed period and the registrar is not satisfied as to the person's qualification as a voter, the registrar shall follow the requirements of section 121, subsection 1-A to place the person's name on the incoming voting list and challenge the absentee ballot. An application by telephone under section 753-A, subsection 4 or an application by electronic means under section 753-A, subsection 6 does not establish a presumption of qualification under this section and the requestor must submit a properly completed voter registration application before the clerk may issue an absentee ballot.(§122)",
